### Verify Student Toolbelts

By doing a few quick tests and exercises, as detailed below, ensure that students have functionality of all of the core pieces of their development environment:
- Atom: type `atom` in the command line to verify that it opens properly. Command line tools may need to be installed.
- Atom packages: Be sure that they have linter, minimap,and  open-in-browser installed.
- Chrome: how to open the console
- Git: enter `which git` in the command line to verify installation
- Directory structure: Have students set up a directory at ~/codefellows/201/ in which they will store their classwork. Go over directory structure in general; compare to GUI.

### Unix & Git (slides)

Slides to introduce students to core concepts of file management from the command line and the fundamentals of Git and Github.

### Set up a JavaScript linter
Have students go to the command line and `apm install linter-eslint`. Have them open a new tab in their terminal ( which also shows them that this is something they can do!) and cd to their home directory. Then `atom .eslintrc` in their home directory and copypasta the contents of the .eslintrc file (send it through the class Slack channel, which is a nice verification of that functionality). Then go into the package settings in Atom and make sure that it is looking for that .eslintrc
