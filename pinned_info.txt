Daily ratings:

  1. Did you find lecture beneficial? (1 = Not at all, 10 = Exactly what I needed). If less than 9, feel free to state "Confusing", "Too fast", "Too slow/redundant", etc.  Send a Slack DM (direct message) if you want to be less public with this feedback. I'll do my best to make lecture time more valuable to everyone, and this feedback will help.

  2. How heavy is the combined workload from readings and labs? ( -5 (i.e., negative 5) = Too easy,  0 = Just right,  5 = Too heavy ).  This feedback will help me gauge where we are as a class, and whether I need to make an adjustment in the pace. The curriculum still needs to cover a lot of material, but this feedback will let us smooth out your workload to not be so "bursty".
